  <h3>Develop across all platforms</h3>
  <p>Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build
    apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.</p>
   <h3>Loved by millions</h3>
  <p>From prototype through global deployment, Angular delivers the productivity and scalable
    infrastructure that supports Google's largest applications.</p>


  <p>Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and
  modify according to your program logic and data. Every app has at least a root component.</p>

  <p>Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views.
  Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular,
  reusable, and efficient.</p>

  <p>Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and
  provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.</p>

  <p>An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides
  the Router service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides
  sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>
